it provides a series of executable steps and constructs, that can be hand or file configured to do whatever you need when you give it a request to process. you can also add your own steps.

it can be configured using xml or json or can be extended to use any other document format.

it can work with http to mock out http services, or be extended to work with any request / response mechanism.
